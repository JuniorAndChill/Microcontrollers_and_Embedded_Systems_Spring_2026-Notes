# ENGR 4321: Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems
**Course Outline - Spring 2026**

## Instructor Information
* **Instructor:** Dr. Okan Çağlayan (Pronunciation: Chah lah yahn)

---

## Course Description
This course introduces fundamental concepts of microcontrollers and embedded systems through physical computing and project-based learning (PBL). Students will design and implement sensor-driven systems using **Arduino**, **ESP32**, and **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** platforms. Key areas of focus include system architecture, hardware-software integration, timing, and communication.

### Prerequisites
An undergraduate course in programming and electronics (e.g., ENGR 2340, ENGR 3362) or equivalent experience.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion, students will be able to:
1. Describe microcontroller-based architecture.
2. Design sensor/actuator interfaces (polling and interrupt-driven).
3. Apply timing and state-based logic.
4. Integrate components into functional cyber-physical systems.
5. Use built-in libraries and development tools (Wokwi, Fritzing, Thonny).
6. Communicate designs through written reports and oral presentations.
7. Work effectively in multidisciplinary teams.
8. Understand wireless communication and IoT systems.
