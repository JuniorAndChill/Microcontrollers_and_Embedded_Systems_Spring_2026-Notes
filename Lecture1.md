# ENGR 4321 Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems Spring 2026
## Lecture 1
- Jan 12 2026

## Course Overview

### Course Objectives
- Understand and explain how embedded systems sense, process, and act in real-world applications.
- Design and implement embedded and cyber-physical systems using Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Pico platforms.
- Apply project-based learning to develop, test, and refine system-level solutions
- Integrate hardware and software using simulation and documentation tools to analyze system behavior.
- Communicate technical designs effectively through diagrams, reports, and presentations while collaborating in multidisciplinary teams.

### How to Succeed in This Course
1. Success depends on engagement and system thinking, not memorizing code
2. Much of the learning happens in class through guided activities and teamwork (Attendance)
3. Coding is introduced as needed to support system behavior
4. Simulation tools (Wokwi) are used to **test ideas before hardware**
5. Clear **documentation and explanations** matter as much as working results
6. Collaboration is encouraged, but **each student is responsible for their own work.**

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Treating this as a programming-only course
- Copying code without understanding **system** behavior
- Ignoring wiring, pin assignments, or power considerations **(Grounding)**
- **Trusting simulation results without questioning assumptions**
- ~~Waiting until the deadline to integrate or debug~~
- Submitting work without clear explanations or diagrams
- **Start early. Ask questions. Think like an engineer.**
